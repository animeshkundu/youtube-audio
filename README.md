Youtube Audio 
=============

Extension for turning off video on youtube. 

I mostly listen to songs a lot on youtube while working. The video playing in the background just heats up my laptop, eats up my battery and data / bandwidth. Youtube doesn't provide this functionality natively.

Disable video for youtube songs which saves battery life and bandwidth / data.

Available on firefox - [youtube-audio](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-audio/?src=search)

I don't have a safari or chrome developer account. Anyone willing to help, please PM me. :)
